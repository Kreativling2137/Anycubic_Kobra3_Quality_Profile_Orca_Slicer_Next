These are profiles for Anycubic Kobra 3 v1. These are no fast profiles, but quality profiles and more slow.

The profiles are for PLA and PETG. Please always select the filament AND the process-profile.

EDIT: There are additional profiles for Kobra 3 v2 for SlicerNext - please choose the correct files for your printer
These files are not finally tested, but same as v1. Why? We don't have the printer, but many people in the forum asked: https://forum.drucktipps3d.de/forum

unzip the .ZIP

import the file in SlicerNext

choose your printer

choose filament and process profile

have fun :-)
